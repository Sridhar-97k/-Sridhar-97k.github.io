      <p>
        Hi! I'm a Software Engineer currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Florida. 
        With over 5 years of experience at Cadence Design Systems, I've specialized in building production-grade 
        Eclipse RCP IDEs for embedded systems development. I'm passionate about systems programming, compiler design, 
        and creating robust tools that help developers build better software. My expertise spans across multi-core 
        debugging, memory management, and distributed systems.
